Welcome to the DiscsInTheBag.com open source project. I started this as a pet project and have been struggling to keep it updated and also to find the time to develop additional features. A developer friend suggested I make it open source so here we are (thanks Parker!). I’m hopeful that folks from the disc golf community who have ideas for how to evolve the site feel invited to join in. I’m learning along the way so please let me know if you have ideas for how to improve the open sourcing as well. Cheers! -Jeremy
